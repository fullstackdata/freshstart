### Active recall

* <b>P</b>recision = (True <b>P</b>ositives)/(True <b>P</b>ositives +  False <b>P</b>ositives)
* Recall = True Positives/ Total Positives
* Regularization - Techniques to improve the generalizabilty of a model by reducing overfitting
* Sensitivity = same as RECALL
* Specificity = Similar to recall, for negative cases - True Negatives/Total Negatives
* Standard deviation = Square root of variance
* Standardization = A common scaling methond, (observation - mean)/S.D
