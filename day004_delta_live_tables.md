<p>A recurring theme in managing Data Science and Machine Learning projects is that often operational overhead is cutting into a Data Scientist's or a Machine Learning 
Engineer's responsibilities.
To be a data driven organization, data lifecycle management, data quality and data governance problems have to be tackled first.
Ten years back, writing a simple map reduce task needed setting up so many dependencies. Same with Machine Learning projects. Thanks to Big Data frameworks and cloud 
infrastructure, they are simplified to a great extent. Now with all the enormous capabilities we have at our disposal, the main problem most enterprises are now dealing 
with is how to feed good quality data consistently with minimum effort. </p>

<b>Infrastructure As Code</b><br/>
It is a widely accepted practice to have CI/CD pipelines so that deployments can be managed with repeatable, foolproof processes in all environments.

### Data As Code
To be data-driven, it is only logical to treat data as code:
  * Governance
  * Versioning
  * Quality Standards
  * Dependencies
