# LLVM
Compilers translate code written in programming languages like C, C++ to assembly instructions.
Compilers have optimization tricks like constant folding, function inlining etc.
However traditional compilers are monolithic and it is hard to add more optimizations.

LLVM compilers are modular and new optimizations can be added.
With high level programming languages like Java which does memory management as well, there is a huge gap between the programming language code and the 
assemb
